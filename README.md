# srv-scripts
This repository is my collection of scripts that I use to set up my servers.  

## ssh-setting-up
This script is used to set up ssh keys for a user on a remote server.   
The ssh key is fetched from GitHub, so there is less hassle!

### Usage
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/6mile0/srv-scripts/main/ssh-setting-up/exec.sh | bash
```
